        <strong><a href="https://grasshopper.app/why-coding/" target="_blank" title="coding">Coding</a></strong>,
        sometimes called computer programming,
        is how we communicate with computers.
        Code tells a computer what actions to take,
        and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
        By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.
        You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data,
        and do lots of other cool things.
